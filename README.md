# alxndr

A bot named alxndr that plays Box Risk (BRISK!) that David Lee, Jeremy Press, and I developed. Like its namesake, it has a history of conquering huge swaths of the planet in an age-old quest for world domination.

Unlike its namesake, it won third place in the 2015 Box Intern BRISK Competition.
